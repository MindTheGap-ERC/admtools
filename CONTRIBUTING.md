## Contribution guidelines

### Reporting bugs {#reporting-bugs}

Suspect or found a bug? To report it, use the GitHub issues [here](https://github.com/MindTheGap-ERC/admtools/issues), and tag your issue with the "bug" label. Please describe the bug in as much detail as you can, including (1) a description of the unexpected behavior you observed (2) what behavior you expected and (3) (if possible) a minimum running example. The more detailed your bug report is, the easier it is for us to fix, and the faster we will be able to fix it.

### Request features or enhancements

Do you think the codebase is lacking, could use a cool new feature, or should better integrate with existing codebases or packages? Then submit your feature/enhancement request in the [Github issues](https://github.com/MindTheGap-ERC/admtools/issues) using the "enhancement" label. Please describe in detail what the new feature should do, and how it should integrate with the existing codebase or other packages. We will review each enhancement request and decide on a case-by-case basis if we will implement it. Our decision is guided both by the usefulness of the request and available development time.

### Improving documentation

Do you think the documentation is lacking? We're always happy to improve! If you want to improve documentation, fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request with the "documentation" label. We will include your improvements into the code base after a review.

### Contributing code and features

Would you like to contribute a new feature to the code base, or improve existing code? Then fork the repository, add your features, and submit a pull request using the "enhancement" label. We will decide on a case-by-case basis if the pull request is accepted or not. This will be discussed with all active authors and contributers to the code base. Criteria for inclusion of new code are code quality, clarity and utility of the features, and whether the new feature enhances the original idea of the code base. If you are unsure if your feature would fit into the codebase, please use GitHub issues to discuss your idea (using the "enhancement" label) so we can give you feedback.

While this is not a criterion for code inclusion, we strongly encourage that each new feature includes tests that ensure that the feature works as intended and integrates with the existing codebase seamlessly.

When you contribute new functionality please add it to the list of available functionality under `vignettes/admtools_doc.Rmd`
